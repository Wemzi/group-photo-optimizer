Group photo optimizer

The end goal of this android app is to have an app where multiple group photos can be taken, and using neural networks a photo can be created where everyone has a positive looking face.

We use tensorflow, tensorflow lite, and java based android.

The repo contains the Python teaching code as well as the android source code for building the app.
